# Exiting the Planning Center

The chamber quieted. The questions, the anger, the weariness — all of it seemed to settle like dust after a storm. One by one, the Elders returned to their seats, their luminous forms resuming their places in the great semicircle. Yet as they sat, their light did not dim. Instead, it swirled outward, rising from their auras in ribbons of radiance that stretched beyond the chamber, flowing toward Earth.

The soul turned its gaze to the glowing globe. Something was happening. The light of the Council streamed into it, and for the first time, the soul could see not only its pain but its laughter, its beauty. Images unfolded across the globe’s surface:

— Children laughing as they played in a street, their joy spilling like sunlight.
— Families working side by side in gardens, coaxing food from the soil with reverence and delight.
— Hands joining across divisions, lifting one another in kindness.
— Inventions born from imagination and shared freely, designed not for profit but for relief.
— Music drifting from homes, marketplaces, and gatherings, carrying the pulse of celebration.

The Earth, though denser and smaller, bore resemblance to what the soul had seen in its journey through the higher realms. It was imperfect, yes, but the echoes were undeniable — glimpses of heaven mirrored in the soil of Earth.

The soul felt a stir in its heart. And then — a warmth at its side. It turned and realized its guide was there, standing as quietly and faithfully as ever. And beyond the guide, its soul group shimmered, luminous and loving, their presence strong and sure. They had been there all along, bearing witness to the entire encounter, holding the soul even when it had forgotten they were near.

The Council’s voice rose together, not one Elder but many, harmonizing like chords in a single song. “This was intense, yes,” they said, their voices flowing as one. “But necessary. You have seen why things are as they are, and how the shadow yields at last to light. You wonder if the truth is too vast to hold? It is. No one soul can carry it all. That is why we are together. We share in the holding. And in the holding, we grow.”

The guide stepped forward, laying a gentle hand on the soul’s shoulder. His eyes glowed with kindness. “You did not face this alone,” he said. “You never do. Even when you thought yourself abandoned, you were carried. Even when you raged, you were loved. And when you faltered, we held you.”

Tears of light welled in the soul’s eyes. It turned back to the Council, its voice soft, almost shy. *“I would like to be back with my soul group now. To sit with them. To rest.”*

The Elders’ radiance seemed to swell, and their voices flowed like a benediction. “Of course. You are free to come and go wherever you wish in this realm. Nothing binds you. You are beloved. We are always here, always holding you in our light.”

The soul bowed its head. For the first time since entering the chamber, its aura pulsed with peace. The lessons were not all clear, not fully grasped, but they no longer needed to be. What mattered was this: it did not carry them alone.

With that, the Council’s light continued to stream toward Earth, weaving its glow into the world below. The soul turned, its guide and group beside it, and stepped once more into the vastness of eternity — not in fear, but in freedom.
