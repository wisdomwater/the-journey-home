## Twilight in the Park

The journey from the Planning Center felt lighter, as though the weight of the chamber’s gravity had been replaced by a softness that invited rest. The soul walked alongside its guide and group, and eventually silence gave way and laughter rose among them — low, easy, effortless, like water bubbling over stones. The air itself seemed to brighten at their joy, carrying it forward as though the whole realm delighted in their release.

Ahead stretched a park, wide and welcoming, its meadows bathed in a twilight glow.

Here, twilight was not darkness. There was no night as the soul had known it on Earth. Instead, the light dimmed gently, tenderly, as though the heavens themselves whispered: *now, rest awhile.* Stars did not pierce the sky, for the sky itself shimmered like a living canvas, deep hues of rose and indigo flowing together. Across it streaked lines of silver light, like comets painting arcs of beauty across the firmament. A breeze carried the fragrance of jasmine and grass, mingled with the faintest trace of honey. Even the ground seemed to sigh in welcome, the grass glowing faintly beneath their feet.

The soul’s group returned to the table where they had gathered before. The table itself now seemed alive, polished wood shot through with veins of starlight, reflecting the twilight like water. Upon it lay small desserts they had picked up in the city’s marketplace — confections of light that shimmered like jewels, yet melted sweetly upon the tongue. Their plates glowed with soft hues as though each morsel had been crafted by joy itself.

They sat together, nibbling and savoring, their laughter warm, their auras mingling like lanterns in the dusk. For a long while, there was no need for words. It was enough to simply *be.*

At last one soul leaned forward, eyes bright, voice humming with excitement. “I’m going to the countryside,” she said with a smile. “I want to learn more about farming, about coaxing life from the soil. The farmer showed us only the beginning. There’s more joy there to taste.”

Another nodded eagerly, aura flickering green and gold. “I’ll join you. I want to see what it feels like to grow food with my own hands — not from hunger but from delight. To sweep my arm and watch trees burst into blossom. What a wonder that must be!” As he spoke, the fragrance of soil and rain seemed to rise in the soul’s imagination, already alive with anticipation.

Across the table, another spoke, her aura glowing warmly like the ember of a hearth. “I’m heading to the suburbs. They’re building a new playground for the children, and I want to help. To set the swings, to paint the fence, to laugh with them as they play. The sound of their joy fills me more than anything else.”

Two others, their light steady and sure, exchanged a glance before speaking. Their words came like a chord played in harmony. “We are going back to Earth,” one said simply. “There is still work to do there. The veil is thinning, and hearts are waking. We will carry light into the shadows, now with greater strength, for we know the Council’s support flows with us.”

They turned toward the soul, their eyes soft and steady. “And you? What will you do?”

The soul shrugged, gazing down at its dessert, then back up at the twilight sky. The confection shimmered like crystal sugar but melted instantly on the tongue, releasing sweetness that lingered long after. *“I don’t know,”* the soul admitted. *“I don’t think I’m ready to go back to Earth. Not yet.”*

“That is okay,” the guide said, his voice gentle, full of reassurance. “Earth will always be there, waiting to receive your light, to be graced by your gifts. There is no rush. There is time here — cycles of learning, cycles of rest. You need only choose what nourishes your soul.”

Another member of the group added softly, “Rest is not a delay — it is part of the dance. Creation needs its pauses. Music is shaped not only by notes but by silence. You have carried much. Now you may breathe.”

The soul’s shoulders eased, tension dissolving it had not even known remained. Around the table, nods and smiles glowed like candles, affirming the truth: resting was as sacred as any work.

When they had finished, the group turned their chairs to face the water at the park’s edge. The lake mirrored the twilight sky, rippling softly, streaked with silver and rose. Trees bent gently at its borders, their leaves glowing as though each carried a tiny lantern. Fireflies of light drifted lazily over the surface, tracing soft spirals.

Music floated faintly, quieter now — less a chorus than a lullaby, flowing not from instruments but from creation itself. The wind hummed. The water sighed. The grass whispered. Even the comets streaking above seemed to move in rhythm, like slow dancers bowing across the stage of the heavens.

The group joined in softly, not with words but with tones that rose and blended into the lullaby, their auras pulsing gently with each note. The soul added its own hum, surprised by how naturally it rose, as though its very being had become an instrument tuned to love.

Breathing deeply, the soul felt its chest rise and fall in a rhythm of peace. For the first time, breath was not survival, but abundance, each inhale a gift, each exhale an offering. It felt not only its own peace but that of its group, woven together into a shared rest that rippled outward like light upon the lake.

“This is home,” the soul whispered to itself. “I have always been here. And I always will be.”

The words were echoed by its companions, not in unison but like a round of song — one voice after another, overlapping, affirming, each tone unique yet harmonious. The guide placed a steady hand upon the soul’s shoulder, eyes warm with infinite kindness.

Above them the sky shimmered, comets of light arcing gracefully through the twilight. The group leaned back together, their laughter softened now, their joy quiet but deep. No striving remained, no questions pressed. Only wholeness. Only love. Only rest.

And in that twilight park, embraced by friends, soothed by the lullaby of creation, the soul found its ending — which was not an ending at all, but a return.

Home.
