# Chapter 8

The guide lifted a hand, and before them shimmered a portal — not small, but towering, its surface a curtain of living light that rippled like water in the sun. Colors poured and shifted across it, hues that had no name on Earth — violet threaded with gold, blue veined with fire. The air around it hummed like strings plucked on a great instrument. Together they stepped through.

At once the soul found itself before the walls of the Heavenly City. They rose high and wide, vast enough to make mountains seem small, yet they did not oppress. Instead, they embraced, holding the City like cupped hands holding a flame. The walls themselves were alive, their colors in constant motion: sapphire melting into emerald, gold deepening into crimson, a living tapestry of light. They were not built to bar or exclude, but to give form to the radiance within, to shape the brilliance into a place that could be entered, shared, cherished.

The gates stood open — tall as cliffs, their frames gleaming like polished silver, etched with designs that shifted as the eye lingered. One moment they bore patterns of stars, the next of rivers, the next of vineyards heavy with fruit. No guards stood watch; none were needed. The gates themselves radiated welcome, their silent invitation carrying the warmth of a thousand embraces. Every inch whispered, *Come home.*

Inside, the City blazed with motion and light. Towers stretched upward like living pillars, some straight and gleaming, others spiraled with grace, crowned with peaks of flame and crystal. They seemed not so much built as grown, their surfaces alive with flowing patterns — vines of gold, lattices of sapphire, constellations of light that shifted with each breath.

Above, streams of radiance darted like shooting stars, zipping from tower to tower, carrying messages and songs that left trails glowing in their wake. The very air pulsed with rhythm, steady and strong, as though the City itself were a great beating heart. It did not weigh down — it lifted. Each pulse seemed to breathe through the soul, drawing it deeper into joy.

The streets beneath their feet were no mere stone. They shimmered as if woven from glass and water, catching the light in endless patterns that shifted with each step — sometimes forming waves, sometimes stars, sometimes ripples as though the soul were walking across the surface of a pond. Every motion carried music: footsteps rang like bells, laughter chimed like strings, even the hush of breath became part of the song.

The guide led the soul forward, and soon the path widened into a great plaza. Here the City seemed to pause, as though all movement had converged into this one sacred circle. And at its center rose the fountain.

It was not carved of stone, nor cast in marble, but made entirely of living water. Jets arched high into the air, each stream shimmering with its own hue — silver like moonlight, gold like dawn, rose like a blooming flower, others iridescent as opal. The water did not fall with a splash but with a song. Each drop released a tone — laughter, melody, prayer, joy — blending seamlessly into the City’s larger harmony. It was as if the fountain itself held the voices of every age, every soul, singing them into unity.

Mist drifted outward in gentle veils, cool and sweet, carrying the fragrance of gardens and rain. The air glittered with droplets that refused to fall, each bead of water a tiny prism catching the colors of eternity.

Around the fountain, souls gathered in a vast throng, and the sight struck the soul with awe. Here were people of every age of Earth’s story — mingling side by side as though no centuries divided them.

One soul wore the flowing robes of ancient Greece, speaking animatedly with a man clad in the bronze armor of Rome. Beside them, a woman in the heavy silks of the Middle Ages laughed with a gentleman in a Victorian coat, his tall hat tipped back as though in casual greeting. A child in a bright 21st-century t-shirt leaned eagerly over the fountain’s edge, splashing at the luminous waters, while an elder in a fur-lined cloak from centuries past knelt beside him, laughing just as freely.

The longer the soul looked, the more astonishing it became. A sailor from forgotten navies recounted a tale to an astronaut in a sleek silver suit; a desert nomad shared bread with a scholar surrounded by fluttering parchment scrolls; monks in simple robes chanted softly while children from distant futures danced around them in spirals of light. The plaza buzzed not with chaos, but with harmony — countless voices interwoven like threads in a single tapestry.

The soul whispered, almost to itself, “They… they are from every time.”

The guide’s voice was warm, steady. “Yes. But you must understand — here there is no *past* and no *future.* There is only the now. What you see are not centuries colliding, but consciousness revealed. Every soul carries the colors of its age, and here they shine together in the eternal present. The robes of Greece, the coats of the Victorians, the laughter of children, the curiosity of the moderns — all belong. Not because of when they lived, but because of what they carry within.

“Time separated them on Earth. But here, time falls away. They are joined not by years, but by states of mind — wonder, devotion, play, discovery, love. The fountain is their meeting place, where all rivers converge into the same ocean.”

The soul’s eyes widened, watching the countless faces and voices blending without erasure. It now understood: no moment of history had been wasted. Each age, with its beauty and its folly, had shaped humanity’s great story. Every invention, every prayer, every song had left a note in the chorus. And now, here in this plaza, all those notes rose together — not erased into sameness, but cherished in their difference, unified in love.

The soul turned slowly, taking it all in. Painters mixing colors that glowed brighter than the sun. Musicians playing instruments that shimmered with liquid fire. Storytellers gesturing in great arcs, and the air itself painted their words in light. Children raced between them, scattering sparks with each footfall. Elders sat together, trading memories like treasures, each story met with laughter that rolled through the crowd like thunder softened by joy.

Everywhere, life flowed with the energy of the fountain — perpetual creation, perpetual reunion.

The soul gazed again at the fountain, watching streams of water leap skyward and fall in radiant arcs. Suddenly it seemed to see them differently — each jet a timeline, each stream an era, rising distinct yet falling together into the same pool.

The guide followed the soul’s gaze. “Yes. That is the truth of it. Every time is represented because every time is here, now. The waters do not remember the stream from which they came — they only know their belonging to the sea.”

The fountain’s spray brushed across the soul’s skin like cool silk. It closed its eyes and felt it: the laughter of Greece, the fire of Rome, the songs of monks, the inventions of moderns, the dreams of futures not yet lived on Earth — all flowing into one endless river, carrying everything forward.

When the soul opened its eyes again, tears of light streamed down its cheeks. “I see. Nothing is lost. Every age still sings.”

The guide smiled, radiant as the fountain’s spray. “Yes. Love gathers all things to itself. History was never a chain of fading moments. It was always one unfolding present. And here you stand, within it.”

The soul bowed its head, trembling with awe. Around it, the voices of every century rose like a single choir, and the fountain sang louder, its waters leaping higher, as if celebrating the truth unveiled.

The soul felt not only part of the City, but part of the whole vast story of creation — past and future collapsing into the joy of now.
