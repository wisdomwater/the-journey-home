# The Gates and the Fountain

The guide lifted a hand, and before them shimmered a portal — not small, but towering, its surface a curtain of living light that rippled like water in the sun. Together they stepped through.

At once the soul found itself before the walls of the Heavenly City. They rose high and wide, yet did not oppress. Their colors shifted — sapphire melting into emerald, gold deepening into crimson, a living tapestry of light. The walls were not to bar or exclude, but to shape, to give form to the radiance within.

The gates yawned open, tall as mountains, their frames gleaming like polished silver. No guards stood watch; none were needed. The gates themselves radiated welcome, beckoning all who approached.

Inside, the City blazed with motion. Towers of light climbed skyward, their peaks crowned in brilliance. Above, streams of radiance darted like shooting stars, zipping from one place to another with joyous purpose. The very air pulsed in rhythm — steady, strong — as though the City itself were alive, a great beating heart.

The soul and the guide walked through the gates and stepped into a vast plaza. Here the energy shifted. The movement of the streets converged into a great circle of gathering, and at its center rose the fountain.

It was not stone nor marble, but pure living water. Jets arched high into the air, each stream shimmering with color — some silver, some gold, some rainbowed with shifting hues. As the water fell, it did not splash but sang, releasing harmonies that blended seamlessly with the music of the City. The sound was laughter and song and prayer all at once.

Around the fountain, souls gathered in a great throng. The sight struck the soul with awe. Here were people of every age of Earth’s story — side by side, mingling as though no centuries divided them.

One soul wore the flowing robes of ancient Greece, another the armor of Rome. Beside them stood a woman clothed in the heavy silks of the Middle Ages, speaking easily with a man in a Victorian coat and hat. Nearby, a child in a bright 21st-century t-shirt leaned over the fountain’s edge, splashing playfully, while an elder in a long cloak from centuries past laughed along with him.

Everywhere, eras collided and blended. Merchants of the Middle Ages conversed with scholars of the Enlightenment. Sailors from forgotten navies shared stories with astronauts from Earth’s future. There was no hesitation, no division — only the hum of conversation, buzzing like bees, weaving joy into the air.

The fountain’s energy and the conversations’ energy fused together, forming a spectacle of sound and light that seemed to lift the whole plaza into radiance. It was not chaos, but harmony — countless voices woven into one song of reunion.

The soul could hardly speak. “They… they are from every time…”

The guide’s voice was warm, steady. “Yes. Love flows freely across the centuries. Here there is no time, only states of mind. What you see are souls carrying the uniqueness of their age into the eternal present. The robes of Greece, the coats of the Victorians, the laughter of children, the ease of the moderns — all belong here. For the soul does not lose its story. It brings its colors into the tapestry. And the fountain is their meeting place, where all waters converge.”

The soul stood transfixed. It saw now that no moment of history was wasted. Each age, with its beauty and its folly, had shaped a facet of humanity that was still singing, still alive. And here, in this plaza, they all flowed together — not erased, not blended into sameness, but cherished in their difference, unified in love.
