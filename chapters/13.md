## Reunion in the Halls of Wisdom

The soul drifted among the glowing tables, watching companions laugh and learn together. Everywhere, light shimmered with curiosity and delight. Then, without warning, it felt a tug — a warmth blooming in its chest, like a chord struck deep within. The soul froze.

Across the hall, one circle of learners had risen to its feet. Their auras flared with color — golden, sapphire, violet — weaving into a tapestry of welcome. They waved with both hands, laughter in their eyes.

“There!” one called, voice bright with joy. “Over here! We’ve been waiting for you!”

A rush of recognition flooded the soul. Its pace quickened, until suddenly it was wrapped in arms of light. Companions pressed their foreheads to its own, tears glistening like pearls, laughter ringing like bells. Some whispered words of greeting, others simply held it close. In that moment, time itself seemed to dissolve. There was no separation, no distance — only the joy of reunion, the deep recognition of family.

“You’re home,” one said softly, squeezing its hand. “And now the fun truly begins.”

The circle guided the soul back to their table. Upon it lay a book of light, pages shimmering with images that shifted like reflections on water. One companion leaned forward, aura sparkling with playful energy.

“We’re practicing something new,” they explained. “The art of reliving past memories — not just our own, but each other’s. That way we can study them together, for growth.”

They flicked a wrist, and the book leapt open. A scene rose into the air, swelling until it hovered above the table like a living window. The sound of horses, the clatter of cart wheels, merchants shouting in a crowded street from centuries past. In the center stood a younger version of the companion, locked in a heated quarrel.

The group leaned closer, gazes full of curiosity. One reached out and brushed the image with gentle fingers. Their breath caught as the emotions rippled into them.

“Ah,” they murmured, “this moment carried pain, yes. But look here — your choice to hold back kept the quarrel from wounding deeper. That restraint planted a seed.”

Another traced the edge of the vision. Instantly the perspective shifted, revealing the companion’s face twisted in anger. “And here — see where you were triggered? The energy spilled outward, hurting you both. Not a failure, only a lesson. Watch how it unfolds into the next moment.”

As they shifted the view again, ripples spread outward from the quarrel, showing how the emotions echoed through choices and consequences beyond that day. Yet the circle spoke without condemnation — only warmth, curiosity, and encouragement. Each voice lifted another, as though all were weaving meaning from the threads of memory.

The soul watched in awe. “You… you can study each other’s lives?”

“Of course,” one said with a smile. “We are bound together. What one learns, all of us learn. Your story belongs to us, as much as our stories belong to you.”

Then they turned toward the new arrival, eyes bright. “Here — you try it.”

The soul froze. The glowing book waited before it, pages pulsing with invitation. But in its mind flickered the memory of the life review — the shame of reliving painful moments, the raw weight of mistakes. Fear prickled along its being.

“But… what if I’m judged?” it whispered. “What if I fail again?”

The group fell quiet. Their auras softened, glowing like lanterns in the dusk. Compassion surrounded the soul as tangibly as their arms had a moment ago.

Before they could answer, the guide stepped close, resting a steady hand on the soul’s shoulder. “There is nothing to fear here. No lesson is borne alone. Each light strengthens the others, and each stumble reveals another facet of truth. In this place, there is no failure — only learning. And every learning is shared.”

The soul lowered its gaze, trembling still. Yet the warmth of their embrace lingered. Slowly, it raised its hand toward the book and flicked the air. Nothing happened. A nervous laugh escaped.

“Try again,” the guide encouraged, voice filled with kindness. “Not with fear, but with trust.”

The soul breathed deeply, steadied itself, and flicked again. This time the book flared wide, and a scene burst upward into the air — vivid, unmistakable. A memory from its most recent Earth life.

Gasps of delight and laughter rang out. “Yes!” one companion cheered, clapping it on the back. Another clasped its hand warmly. “You did it! Now let’s learn together.”

The circle leaned in, tracing the memory’s edges. Light rippled as they shifted perspectives, feeling emotions, uncovering cause and effect, following threads of choice through time. There was no judgment, only wonder — every detail treated as treasure, every struggle as a key.

As the soul watched, its fear melted into exhilaration. This was no solitary burden of shame. Growth was shared, discovery multiplied by love.

It felt its being expand with new freedom. For the first time it understood: life itself was a shared adventure, each step of the journey illuminating another facet of the diamond of wisdom.

And here, among those who loved it most, even the hardest lessons became radiant.
