# The Rest

### Into the Meadow of Renewal

The banquet lingered long, filled with laughter, tears, and the warmth of shared memory. But slowly, gently, the celebration began to quiet. Souls rose one by one, embracing, clasping hands, leaving parting words that were not really partings.

“We’ll see you tomorrow,” one said with a grin, though in this world there was no “tomorrow.”
“Don’t forget to tell us more,” said another, their aura flickering with delight.

There was no sadness in their departures — only ease, the knowing that reunion was never truly broken here. One by one, the circle slipped away into the glow of light beyond the hall, until the room stood quiet again.

At last, only the soul and its guide remained.

The guide turned, eyes soft with affection. “You must be tired. This life was your most challenging yet. Would you like to rest?”

The soul paused, noticing itself. After the fullness of the review, the embrace of family, the sharing of memories, it did indeed feel whole — but also heavy in a different way. Not burdened, but saturated, as after a great feast. Full, happy… and ready to digest, to let it all settle.

“Yes,” the soul whispered. “I would.”

The guide smiled. With a wave of the hand, another portal blossomed in the air before them. Not brilliant gold this time, but a soft green glow, cool and inviting, like the first breath of spring after winter. A refreshing breeze seemed to pour from it, carrying the scent of grass and water.

“Come,” said the guide.

The soul stepped forward, and at once the scene unfolded: a countryside bathed in gentle light. Rolling green hills stretched into the distance, swaying with tall grasses kissed by the wind. Beyond them, mountains rose with quiet majesty, their peaks softened by haze, ancient yet welcoming.

The sky arched above, rich and blue, brushed with wisps of clouds drifting effortlessly. The light was everywhere — not harsh, but nurturing, a radiance that seeped into the soul’s very pores, warming, soothing, renewing.

At the heart of the meadow lay a pond, its waters still and clear, mirroring sky and hill, broken only by the faint ripple of a breeze. The air hummed with quiet life — birdsong faint, grasses whispering — all suffused with a peace deeper than silence.

By the water’s edge sat two Adirondack chairs, crafted not of wood but of light given form, perfectly solid yet shimmering faintly. Their backs faced the hills, angled toward the pond, as if placed long ago for this very moment.

The guide gestured with a tender smile. “Would you like to sit?”

The soul nodded. Together they walked to the chairs, and as they settled in, the seats seemed to cradle them perfectly, conforming to their being. The soul exhaled — not the weary exhale of a body struggling to breathe, but the deep sigh of one who is finally at peace.

For the first time since leaving Earth, the soul felt not the work of lessons or the rush of reunion, but simple rest. A pause. A being.

And beside it, the guide leaned back, eyes turned toward the still pond, content simply to sit together in the quiet glow.

### The Meadow of Healing

The two sat quietly by the pond, the chairs angled just so, the guide’s presence steady beside the soul. For a while, there was no need for words. The meadow itself was speaking in its own soft language.

On the pond, ducks glided effortlessly across the mirrored surface. Their movements left delicate ripples that shimmered with light. Every so often, one bent its head, scooping water with a gentle bill, then lifting again with a satisfied shake, droplets scattering like diamonds in the air.

Beneath them, small fish stirred. They rose toward the surface, breaking it with tiny bubbles that tickled the silence. Some leapt briefly, as though tasting the sky, then slipped back into the silver depths with ease.

To the right, a brook wound its way into the pond, laughter threading from its waters as they tumbled over smooth stones. Its bubbling sound was like a lullaby — constant, tender, soothing, as if the Earth itself was exhaling in joy.

The soul leaned back, watching, listening. Everything shimmered faintly, alive with aura. The ducks glowed in hues of soft amber. The fish shimmered silver-blue. The grasses, bending in the breeze, radiated a faint green halo. The brook itself sparkled with light, each drop like a tiny prism.

And the harmony was complete. No predator lurked here, no prey fled. Every lifeform simply existed, each in its own rhythm, all woven together in peace.

The soul felt it, not only with sight but with being. The aura of the place seeped inward, washing through every corner of its essence. Muscles of memory unwound. The lingering weight of shame and struggle dissolved. Here, there was no need to guard, no need to strive.

In the stillness, the soul’s being began to melt into oneness — not dissolving into oblivion, but relaxing into belonging. The tension it hadn’t even realized it was still carrying softened, then released.

For the first time since leaving Earth, the soul felt utterly content. Not because it had achieved, not because it had been forgiven, not even because it was loved — but because it simply *was.*

And in that simple being, everything was enough.

The guide sat in silence, smiling faintly, letting the meadow do its work. Healing was not something that had to be given. It rose naturally, like sunlight on skin.

The soul closed its eyes — not in exhaustion, but in rest. And in that quiet stillness, it drifted into perfect peace.

### Dreaming in Yes 🌿 — let’s make this a gentle interlude between deep rest and the next stage of the journey.

### **Chapter 4: The Rest (Part III — Dreaming in Light)**

As the soul reclined in the chair by the pond, the stillness deepened. Its awareness softened, not lost but drifting, as though carried into a dream woven by the meadow itself.

The dream was made not of sharp images but of *textures of color and sound.* Hues of lavender, rose, and gold moved like tides across the soul’s inner vision, flowing into one another with a slowness that was almost musical. Each color carried a note — not heard with ears but felt deep within — a low hum of safety, a high trill of joy, a warm chord of belonging.

The colors and tones wove together, forming a cradle. The soul felt as though it were being held in vast, gentle arms, rocked without motion, safe beyond any thought of danger. There was no edge to this dream, no boundary. It was endless, yet it was intimate, like a lullaby sung by the universe itself.

It did not ask the soul to think, or to learn, or even to remember. It asked only to rest, to let the waves of color and music move through until every corner of weariness dissolved.

And so the soul dreamed in softness, wrapped in music that seemed to breathe with it, each tone rising and falling like the rhythm of a mother’s chest.

When at last the soul stirred again, it opened its eyes slowly. The meadow was still there — the pond shimmering, ducks drifting lazily, the brook laughing over the stones. The air was fresh, full of warmth and scent of grass.

The soul sighed deeply in relief. “Oh, good,” it whispered. “I was worried this was only a dream.”

The guide, seated beside it, turned with a smile, eyes full of quiet knowing.

“No,” they said gently. “The world you came from — *that* was the dream. This is reality.”

The words sank deep, like stones falling into a pond, rippling outward through the soul’s being. For the first time, it understood: Earth had been a classroom of shadows and echoes. Here was the bedrock, the ground of being. This was what was real — love, harmony, peace.

The soul leaned back again, smiling faintly. For the first time in what felt like forever, it was not afraid.
