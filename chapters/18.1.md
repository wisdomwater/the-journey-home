## Chapter 9: The Cry Against Power

The chamber pulsed with radiance, the Council of Elders seated in their semicircle of light. Their thrones shimmered with authority, their eyes deep with tenderness. And yet, as the soul stood before them, its chest began to tremble — not with awe this time, but with unease.

The Fatherly Elder rose. For a moment his form blazed like dawn, robes of light flowing like rivers of fire. Then, slowly, deliberately, his brilliance softened. His aura dimmed until only a muted glow remained, like an ember after flame. The chamber hushed.

“I feel it,” the Elder said, his voice low, steady as thunder in the distance. “The storm you carry. The darkness unspoken. Do not bury it here. Name it. Speak it. Let the hurt rise. For wounds unspoken fester, but wounds named can be healed.”

The soul’s breath caught. The words struck deep, as though the Elder had reached into its very chest. Its companions shifted, their auras, dimmed in the presence of raw, holy emotion. Even they had not realized how heavy the burden was. The circle leaned close, not to restrain, but to bear witness.

The Father’s face darkened, his light folding inward until shadows cloaked him. “Even if it is rage. Even if it is blasphemy. Even if it is accusation against us — it must be spoken. Say it, child. Here, the darkness belongs.”

The permission shattered the soul’s restraint. Its knees buckled. Memories surged like a torrent, crashing against its mind.

Faces. Voices. Thrones of men.

Pulpits where preachers pounded fists, declaring damnation while hiding their own sins.

Politicians, cloaked in flags, promising justice while feeding upon power. 

Billionaires in glass towers congratulating themselves while families slept in cars.

Bosses exploiting, corporations grinding workers into exhaustion, then discarding them like broken tools.

Teachers silencing questions, calling curiosity rebellion.

Parents withholding tenderness, hiding cruelty behind the mask of righteousness.

The soul’s aura flickered wildly, grief and rage colliding. At last, it erupted.

---

“Shame on you!” the soul cried, its voice like fire ripping through the chamber. “Shame on you for sitting in silence while the world drowns! For letting tyrants feast while children starve! For turning your face while we begged for help!”

Its light flared crimson with fury. “We prayed, and the heavens stayed quiet. We asked, and you gave no answer. We were told you ruled in power, yet the world was ruled by greed and cruelty. Where were you then?”

The companions stood in silence, their auras dimmed, unable to soften the storm.

---

The soul’s voice sharpened, dripping with grief. “And what of your churches? They claimed to speak for you — to proclaim love and truth — but they were thrones of fear! They told us: obey or be cast out. Believe or burn. They clothed themselves in holiness while their hands were filthy with power and control.”

It pointed at the Council, trembling. “Do you know what it is to sit in pews where love was preached, while shame was hammered into your bones? To hear your name twisted into curses because you did not conform? They said it was you. They *swore* it was your voice. And you let them!”

The chamber shook with the soul’s cry.

---

Its anger swelled again, a flood unstoppable. “And the rich!” the soul spat. “The kings, the billionaires, the tyrants! They built towers of glass while mothers wept in the streets. They hoarded food while villages starved. They raised armies to crush the poor, and then thanked you for their victories. They put your name on their coins, on their empires, on their wars!”

The soul’s aura flared so violently the dome above rippled with its fire. “You let them! You let them wear your name while they destroyed your creation!”

---

Now its voice cracked, trembling with anguish. “Do you know what it feels like to cry for justice and hear nothing? To hold a dying child and wonder if heaven has turned its back? To suffer under tyrants and be told it is God’s will? Where were you? Why did you not act?”

The cry broke into sobs of light. “Tell me! If you are love, why did you let us be crushed beneath the boots of power?”

---

The chamber quaked with the eruption. The Council did not move to silence the soul. Their light did not flare in rebuke, nor their faces harden in judgment. They sat, still as mountains, their radiance dimmed in reverence, receiving the storm as though it were a sacred offering.

The Fatherly Elder lowered his head, shadows cloaking his form, and spoke only once more:
“Good. Let it come. Let it all come. The darkness must be spoken, or it will devour you. We will not turn away.”

And so the soul raged, cried, and trembled, every wave tearing free the grief of ages.

When at last its voice broke into silence, the chamber still pulsed with its storm. The Council remained, unmoved yet unshaken, bearing the weight without flinching. The companions leaned close, their faces wet with light, their sorrow mingled with awe.

The soul stood panting, hollowed, emptied — yet still burning with the single question that lingered like fire on its tongue:

“Why?”
