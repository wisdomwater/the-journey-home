# Chapter 9

The soul and the guide stepped away from the great fountain, turning down a wide street lined with arches of living light. The arches curved overhead like branches of luminous trees, each leaf shimmering with patterns that shifted as they passed — stars one moment, blossoms the next, rivers flowing the next. The path itself glowed with soft color, stones alive as if they held dawn within them.

At once the air thickened with new scents — spices, smoke, sweetness, and warmth all mingling into a perfume that made the soul’s whole being tingle. The stirring of conversation deepened into laughter, and music spilled from every corner, weaving into the steady heartbeat of the City.

They had entered the marketplace.

It was unlike any market the soul had ever known. No one hawked goods, no one haggled or clutched coin. There were stalls, yes, and tables overflowing with treasures, but everything here was given freely, offered with joy. Each stand radiated the aura of its maker, glowing faintly with the love of the hands that prepared it.

On one side, merchants of Africa stood beneath bright awnings woven of kente cloth, the patterns alive with shifting colors that seemed to breathe. One soul, draped in flowing robes, stirred a great pot, releasing the scent of stews rich with tomato and spice. Another roasted golden plantains over open flame, their skins crackling as sweet smoke drifted upward. Beside them, drummers tapped out playful rhythms, each beat glowing like sparks that rose into the air and became part of the music. They laughed as they drummed, joy rolling from their bodies like light itself.

The soul was pressed a steaming bowl of stew, the flavor bursting across its tongue — savory and rich, layered with warmth. It tasted not only of tomatoes and spice but of *story* — of family, of hearthfires, of songs sung while stirring the pot. The gift filled the soul not with heaviness but with energy, as though it had been nourished by joy itself.

Across the lane, souls of Asia bustled joyfully around steaming baskets of dumplings. The air was thick with the fragrance of rice, ginger, sesame, and soy. Lanterns of soft red and gold hung from above, glowing as though filled with starlight. A woman in shimmering silk handed the soul a leaf-wrapped parcel. Inside were noodles, long and delicate, glistening faintly as though touched with light.

The soul slurped them gently, and at once the flavors sang — sharp and sweet, earthy and bright, each note distinct yet blending into harmony. Laughter burst from the woman’s lips as the soul’s eyes widened in delight. She pressed her hands together and bowed slightly. The soul bowed back, a gesture exchanged with no words, only joy.

Further down, the scents of Europe drifted warm and inviting. Bakers laid out loaves still steaming, their crusts dusted with flour, while nearby stood wheels of cheese glowing faintly with golden light. Pastries glittered with sugar that sparkled like frost, and long tables gleamed with embroidery, lace, and crystal. A man in a Victorian waistcoat placed a sugared bun into the soul’s hands. The bite was soft, airy, dissolving with sweetness that shimmered through the soul like bells. A child from the modern world darted up, and the baker offered him one as well. They laughed together, no thought of station or time dividing them.

The air shifted again as they moved on, this time thick with cardamom, saffron, and roasting lamb. Merchants from the Middle East sat upon woven rugs, their robes flowing as they lifted copper kettles and poured steaming tea into cups that never seemed to empty. Bowls overflowed with dates and figs, each glistening like gems. One man leaned back in laughter, handing a sweet to a woman in medieval garb, who received it with a bow as though they had always been neighbors.

The soul was offered a cup of tea — fragrant and spiced, warmth rolling through its being. It tasted of desert nights and caravan fires, of hospitality older than empires. The soul closed its eyes, savoring the heat, the sweetness, the gift.

The scents of chocolate and roasted corn reached them next. A stall stood alive with the colors of the Americas. One soul stirred thick chocolate in a stone bowl, the aroma rich and velvety, while another roasted corn over an open fire, the kernels bursting in sparks of light. Bright feathers crowned dancers who wove in circles, their garments alive with reds, yellows, and blues so vivid they seemed to ripple like living rainbows. A boy in a baseball cap clapped along, utterly delighted, while a woman in a feathered cloak pulled him into the dance.

A warm mug of chocolate was placed into the soul’s hands. The first sip was deep and grounding, earthy and rich, yet alive with sweetness. As it swallowed, the flavor echoed with drums, with rainforests, with stories etched into stone. The soul laughed aloud, its own voice joining the chorus.

Toward the end of the street, a gentle chorus rose — the sound of voices blending in harmony. Here, souls of Oceania gathered. Mats woven from palm leaves stretched across the ground, covered in roasted taro, bowls of coconut water, and fruit split open to reveal glowing pulp. Shell necklaces gleamed faintly as gifts, placed over the shoulders of every passerby. Their songs rolled like the sea — deep, resonant, endless. Each voice carried an undertone of waves, as if the ocean itself had joined them in song.

The soul was offered a slice of glowing fruit. Its juice burst like cool water, sweet and refreshing, flooding its being with the rhythm of tides. The music of the singers mingled with the taste, and for a moment, the soul felt as though it were both eating and listening to the ocean itself.

The soul turned slowly, overwhelmed by the richness of it all. Everywhere, hands reached out not to demand, but to give. Food was pressed into palms, fabrics draped across shoulders, jewelry placed gently over heads. Cooks smiled wide as strangers tasted their creations. Artists laughed as others admired their craft. There was no rivalry, no suspicion, no fear of being cheated or overcharged. Only joy. Only abundance.

The guide leaned close, speaking softly over the laughter and music. “On Earth, scarcity taught you to hoard, to grasp, to guard against your neighbor. Fear bred rivalry, envy, war. But here, there is no scarcity. All flows in abundance. And so there is nothing to guard, nothing to take. What remains is the joy of giving, and the joy of receiving.”

The soul looked again — at a Roman soldier clasping hands with a medieval farmer as they shared bread; at a child from the modern world sipping tea poured by an elder in desert robes; at dancers in feathered crowns spinning hand in hand with those in Victorian suits. Peoples who once clashed over borders, wealth, and belief now laughed as brothers and sisters, their differences not erased but celebrated.

The guide continued, voice low and strong. “This is the true purpose of trade — not to win, not to conquer, not to amass, but to share. When each soul brings the fruit of its gift and offers it freely, life becomes richer for all. The baker, the weaver, the farmer, the musician — each one completes the other. And when suspicion is gone, cooperation flowers. No one fears being cheated, because nothing is lost. Abundance is multiplied, not diminished, when it is given.”

The soul felt the truth resonate deep within. Every bite, every sip, every song had been more than taste or sound — it was a culture, a story, a gift of identity. The marketplace was not of things but of love made tangible.

The soul closed its eyes, savoring the sweetness still lingering from the foods it had been given. The joy did not fade but deepened, filling every corner of its being.

When it opened its eyes again, the street stretched onward, curving toward the heart of the City, where towers of light rose higher still.
