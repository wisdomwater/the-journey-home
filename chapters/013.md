# Reunion in the Halls of Wisdom

The soul wandered among the glowing tables, watching groups of companions laugh and learn together, when suddenly it froze. Across the hall, one circle rose to its feet, waving with wide grins. Their auras flared in a burst of color — golden, sapphire, violet — weaving together like a tapestry of welcome.

“There!” one called, their voice bright with joy. “Come over here! We’ve been waiting for you!”

A flood of excitement overcame the soul. It hurried forward, and before it could speak, the group had surrounded it, arms of light wrapping it into embraces. Some laughed, some wept shining tears, some pressed their foreheads to its own in greeting. For a moment, time itself seemed to vanish; there was only the joy of reunion, the deep recognition of family.

“You’re home,” one whispered, squeezing its hand. “And now the fun truly begins.”

The circle guided the soul to their table. Upon it lay a book of light, its pages shimmering with shifting images. One soul leaned forward, their aura sparkling with playful energy. “We’re practicing something new,” they explained. “The art of reliving past memories — not just our own, but each other’s. That way, we can study them together, for growth.”

They flicked their wrist, and the book sprang open. An image lifted into the air, growing until it hovered above the table like a living window. The scene unfolded: a bustling street from centuries ago, merchants shouting, carts clattering over cobblestones. In the center, a younger version of the soul’s companion appeared, caught in a heated argument.

The group gathered close, studying the scene from different angles. One reached out, placing a hand against the image. At once, they gasped softly, feeling the emotions ripple into them. “Ah,” they said gently, “do you see? This moment was painful, yes — but look here, how your restraint kept the quarrel from turning cruel. That choice carried forward.”

Another leaned in, brushing the edge of the scene. The air shimmered, and the perspective shifted, showing the companion’s face contorted in anger. “This was where you were triggered,” they observed kindly. “The energy spilled outward and hurt you both. Not a failure — just a lesson. See how it unfolded into the next moment?”

The group nodded, murmuring with warmth. There was no judgment in their voices, only curiosity, appreciation, and encouragement. Together they traced the cause and effect, seeing not just what had happened, but how it resonated outward into choices, feelings, and consequences.

The soul watched in awe. “You… you can study each other’s lives?”

“Of course,” one said with a smile. “We are bound together. What one learns, all of us learn. Your story belongs to us as much as our stories belong to you.”

They turned, eyes bright. “Here — you try it.”

The soul froze, staring at the book of light. At once, it remembered the life review, the searing shame of reliving moments of pain. Fear prickled within. “But… what if I’m judged?” it whispered. “What if I fail?”

The group fell silent, their auras softening into a glow of reassurance. Before they could answer, the guide stepped forward, placing a steady hand on the soul’s shoulder. “There is nothing to fear here. We grow together, not alone. Your light strengthens theirs, and their light strengthens yours. There is no failure in this place — only learning. You help them as much as they help you.”

The soul swallowed, nodding slowly. It raised its hand over the book, flicked gently — but nothing happened. A nervous laugh escaped.

“Try again,” the guide encouraged, voice full of warmth. “Not with fear, but with trust.”

The soul inhaled, steadied itself, and flicked once more. This time the book flared open, and an image burst into the air — a scene from its most recent Earth life, glowing vividly above the table.

The group cheered, laughter ringing like bells. “See? You can do it!” one cried, clapping it on the back. Another squeezed its hand. “Now let’s get to learning.”

Together they leaned into the memory, tracing the light, reaching out to feel the emotions, studying the ripples with joy and care. The soul felt itself relax, no longer afraid, but exhilarated. For the first time it understood: growth was not a solitary struggle. It was a shared adventure, made radiant in the company of those who loved it most.
