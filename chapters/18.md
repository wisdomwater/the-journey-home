# Chapter 9: The Cry Against Power

The chamber pulsed with a steady radiance, the Council of Elders seated in their semicircle of light. Their presence was vast, their eyes kind, their forms shimmering with facets of eternity. And yet, as the soul stood before them, its heart began to tremble — not with awe, but with something darker.

One of the Elders, the one who had stepped forward as the Fatherly figure, extended a hand. His voice was warm, low, resonant. “Child, you have carried questions heavy in your heart. Speak them now. Nothing here is forbidden. Let all that weighs upon you rise, so it may be seen.”

---

The words should have soothed, but instead they unlocked a flood. The soul looked up at the thrones — high, radiant, towering — and instead of comfort, it felt the old ache of distance. The memory of pews and pulpits, of governments and hierarchies, of leaders enthroned while others struggled below.

Images surged in its mind:

Authority figures who had promised care but delivered harm.

Teachers who silenced questions instead of nurturing them.

Churches that preached love while guarding power with iron fists.

Politicians who spoke of service while feasting on wealth.

Corporate titans extracting life from the poor, leaving only scraps in return.

Systems that crushed creativity, imagination, and compassion beneath rules, quotas, and profit.

The soul’s chest tightened, its aura flickering. The thrones of the Council — luminous though they were — now seemed to echo those seats of power on Earth. Thrones where decisions were made far above, while the world below burned.

---

A fire leapt in its voice. “Shame on you!” it cried, tears of light sparking like embers. “Shame on you for sitting idly by while the world suffers. While greed devours. While children starve. While tyrants reign. While religion, which was supposed to point the way home, twists itself into power and control!”

Its voice shook with rage, filling the chamber. “You sit there in light while we were drowning in darkness. Do you know what it felt like to be ignored, abandoned, crushed under the weight of your silence? To pray for help, for justice, and hear nothing? To watch cruelty thrive while kindness withered? Where were you then?”

The words rang out, raw and untempered. The soul’s aura flared like a storm, its grief and fury finally given voice.

The Council did not move to silence it. The Elders sat in stillness, their light steady, their faces open, receiving the storm as if it were sacred. The Fatherly Elder inclined his head, his eyes full of compassion.

“Good,” he said softly. “Let it out. All of it. Here, at last, you may speak what you could not say on Earth. Tell us everything you carry.”

---

The chamber seemed to lean in, holding its breath. The soul, trembling, felt the tide of anger still surging — words burning, waiting to be spoken.

The soul’s voice cracked as it echoed through the chamber. *“My question is simple. Why? Why have you done this?”*

The words hung heavy, trembling with both grief and accusation. The Elders did not flinch. Instead, the Fatherly figure leaned forward, his light softening like a flame dimmed to listen.

“You see the pain of the world and believe it is our doing,” he said gently, his voice rolling like distant thunder yet tender as a lullaby. “But hear this, child: we did not build tyranny, nor fashion greed, nor place chains upon the innocent. Those shadows were born from the misuse of freedom, the distortion of the gift we gave. We did not create them — but neither did we strike them down. And that is what troubles you most.”

He paused, his eyes shimmering with sorrow, as though he too had walked in the weight of the soul’s grief. “You ask why. Because love cannot coerce. Were we to strip away the power to choose — even to choose cruelty — we would strip away the very possibility of love. And love is the purpose for which all worlds exist.

“So we permitted freedom, knowing it could wound, but also knowing it could heal. We allowed the theater of Earth to unfold, not because we were absent, but because we desired love freely chosen, not obedience compelled.”

---

The Elder’s gaze deepened, steady and unshaken. “We have done this not to abandon you, but to preserve the only soil in which true love can grow. Yet we do not sit idle. Even in the darkest systems, we whisper. We nudge. We send light into the cracks. We weave redemption from the very threads of suffering. But we do so without domination — for domination, even in the name of good, becomes the seed of tyranny again.”

He spread his hands, light flowing outward like rivers. “This is why. Not to justify suffering, but to reveal that the possibility of love required it. And love, freely chosen, will in the end undo every shadow.”

---

The soul’s voice rose again, sharp with anguish, trembling with fury.

“That’s not good enough! You speak of free will as though it justifies everything, but what of the suffering — the endless, grinding suffering? Free will is not worth children starving, nations enslaved, the poor crushed beneath the boots of the powerful! You supposedly hold all the power in the universe. You breathed it all into existence. If you are truly that powerful, why let this continue?

“And what of your prophets, your priests, your churches? They claim to speak for you — and they twist free will into chains. They say: choose as we command or be cast out forever. Obey or burn in darkness. Where is the freedom in that? You hide behind ‘choice’ while terror and manipulation masquerade as your voice. How can you let such lies speak in your name?”

---

The words blazed like fire, echoing off the dome until the chamber itself seemed to tremble. The Elders did not recoil. The Fatherly one let the silence linger, honoring the weight of the accusation, before speaking with a voice steady as the tide.

“You are right to rage at such distortions,” he said softly, sorrow threading his tone. “They wound the heart of love. But understand: those voices — the prophets twisted by pride, the priests drunk on power — did not speak for us, though they clothed themselves in our name. They were men, fragile and afraid, who built thrones of fear to guard what they could not truly control.

“We did not send them to damn, but to awaken. Yet even messengers can warp their message when shadow overcomes them. And when fear sits upon the throne, it cloaks itself in my image, using heaven’s name to wield hell’s tools. That is not our voice, child. That is the echo of fear.”

---

The Elder’s eyes shone with a fierce tenderness now. “We do not banish. We do not condemn to fire. Those stories were born of human hunger for control. They mistook shadow for truth, power for love. We allowed them to speak, for we do not silence even error. But know this: never once did we decree eternal torment. The only fire is love’s own — a fire that heals, not destroys. The outer darkness is not our prison, but the shadow cast by turning away. And every shadow will one day dissolve in light.”

His words fell like balm, though the ache in the soul’s chest still throbbed. The Elder did not deny the pain, but neither did he surrender the truth: love cannot coerce, even in its own defense.

The soul’s voice faltered now, no longer sharp with fire but heavy, weary, trembling with the ache of helplessness.

“But why were they given power at all? Why allow them influence over so many? If you know all things, then surely you knew their corruption. Their obsession with power. Their greed. Why let them sit upon thrones, command armies, rule empires, hoard riches, exploit the poor? Why let their shadows stretch across entire nations?

“If you gave them that power, knowing what they would do… does that not still make you complicit in their aggression?”

The chamber held the weight of the question like a stone sinking into water. The Elders’ light did not waver, but it softened, dimming in reverence for the raw ache that had just been voiced. The Fatherly Elder lowered his head for a moment, as though bowing to the honesty of the wound.

---

When he lifted his gaze again, his eyes shone not with defense, but with grief mingled with love.

“You are right to feel the injustice,” he said quietly. “You are right to call it cruelty when power is abused. But hear this: we do not *grant* such power. We grant the gift of freedom, and with it the field of experience. Souls may choose to rise into service, or to sink into self. Those who crave dominion often climb quickly, for others surrender their freedom in fear or apathy. Yet their ascent is not a blessing of heaven, but a mirror of the hunger they themselves carried.”

He stepped closer, his presence steady as a mountain. “We knew, yes. We saw the seeds of shadow. But to strip away the possibility of corruption would be to strip away the possibility of choice. And without choice, there is no growth, no love. So we allowed the risk, not because we are complicit in their aggression, but because even their corruption can become a teacher. The tyrant becomes the mirror in which the world sees what it will no longer endure. Their rise plants the seeds of their fall. Their cruelty awakens compassion and resistance in others.

“We do not endorse their shadow. But we weave even their shadow into the greater story, so that no lesson is wasted. Complicit? No. Patient? Yes. Patient until all shadows are spent, and only light remains.”

---

His eyes searched the soul’s, tender, unwavering. “I know this answer may not soothe your anger. But you must see: the power they wield was never truly ours to give. It was always their choice, and the choice of those who followed them. And all choices — even the darkest — become threads in the tapestry of love.”

The soul’s voice broke again, sharper this time, weighted with a grief deeper than outrage.

“Even if I accept that tyrants rose on their own hunger, what of the ones who never had a chance? What of disease? Famine? Storms and floods that wipe out homes and lives in a breath? Did a child choose to get cancer? Did families choose to starve? Did people choose to drown when the rivers rose? Where is your precious free will in that?”

---

The chamber trembled with the force of the words. Images flickered through the soul’s mind like jagged lightning — hospital rooms where parents wept beside beds too small for the weight of such suffering, villages hollowed by hunger, storms tearing apart everything familiar.

The Fatherly Elder’s face grew solemn, his light dimming to a gentler glow. “These wounds cut deepest of all,” he said softly, voice carrying a sorrow as old as creation itself. “For they are not born of ambition or malice, but of the fragile fabric of matter itself.”

He spread his hands toward the globe of Earth that hovered in the center of the chamber, glowing with its rivers and mountains, its winds and seas. “Earth was made as a living school. Its stones, its waters, its winds, its fires — they are not puppets, but partners. They move, they shift, they evolve. The body, too, is such a partner — wondrous, delicate, filled with mysteries. But because it is fragile, it can break. And when it breaks, suffering follows.”

The Elder’s eyes glimmered with compassion. “No child *chooses* cancer. No village *chooses* famine. These are not punishments. They are the tremors of a world still unfinished, still becoming. Every star, every planet, every body carries both beauty and limitation. Even so, every instance of suffering is gathered, redeemed, and returned as light.”

---

He paused, and his gaze deepened, carrying a weight that seemed to bend close to the soul’s own heart. “But hear this: never is a soul abandoned to such pain. Even when the body falters, even when the storm strikes, angels gather near. Companions bear witness. And what seems meaningless from below becomes woven from above. The child who suffers becomes a beacon to awaken compassion in thousands. The village that starves teaches nations the cost of neglect. The flood that destroys gives birth to rebuilding, to resilience, to unity. None of this erases the pain — but none of it is wasted.”

The Elder’s voice gentled, like a hand smoothing a trembling shoulder. “Would I wish such trials upon you? Never. Yet even in them, you are never forsaken. Even in them, love surrounds, waiting to turn mourning into seed, sorrow into strength.”

He lifted his hand, and the globe shimmered with streams of light rising from every place where suffering dwelled. “These are not forgotten. Every cry, every tear, is heard. And one day, when the Earth itself matures, such trials will pass. The world you knew is not its final form.
