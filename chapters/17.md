## The Planning Center

The arch of light at the far end of the Halls of Wisdom shimmered like the rim of sunrise. As the soul and its companions approached, the glow deepened, spilling across their faces in waves of gold and silver. Passing through, the soul felt a change at once. The air thickened, not with weight but with presence, as though time itself had slowed to make room for something greater. Each footfall echoed softly, as though the very floor remembered every step taken before.

They entered a chamber vast as the heavens. A dome rose overhead, infinite in scale, alive with constellations that shifted as they watched. Stars bent and swirled into new patterns: a phoenix unfolding, a spiral galaxy blossoming, then dissolving back into scattered points of light. Nebulas bloomed in slow motion, their colors spilling in waves of violet, gold, and emerald. The soul’s breath caught — it was as though the very sky had bent low to witness.

Yet along with awe, something else stirred — a faint unease. The vastness pressed against the soul’s smallness, and though it felt safe among its circle, a quiet memory flickered: the weight of authority on Earth, how it had sometimes been twisted to control. The soul pushed the thought away, but the echo lingered.

At the chamber’s heart floated a luminous globe — Earth. Not stone, not map, but a living presence. Its continents gleamed as though stitched together with threads of light, while streams rose from every shore, ribbons carrying the songs of incarnated souls. Laughter shimmered like bells. Sobs trembled like low thunder. Prayers rose like sparks.

The soul’s chest tightened. It could hear faint echoes of its own last life — moments of love, cries of regret — woven into the song. Around the globe, shadows moved too, but not as enemies. They curved and twisted like sculptors of contrast, shaping the radiance around them. Even turmoil gleamed here, a jewel brightened by its fractures.

Circles of light gathered around glowing tables near the globe. Some bent low over radiant maps, sketching arcs of possibility like artists at work. Others traced paths with their hands, and images spilled upward: a child’s first cry, a reconciliation across years, the loneliness of exile, the triumph of forgiveness. Futures branched outward like rivers of flame, every stream shimmering with potential.

The soul stood transfixed. “This is where… we choose?” it whispered.

“Yes,” one companion murmured, eyes alight. “This is where we dream. Where we weave. Where we lay down the maps of love.”

Then the soul’s gaze lifted, drawn to the far edge of the chamber. There, upon a rising arc of light, sat a semicircle of thrones. And upon those thrones, radiant beyond description, sat the Council of Elders.

They were not identical, nor austere. Each carried a distinct quality: one glowed with the gold of compassion, another with the silver of truth, another with the green of creativity, another with the deep blue of justice. Their silence was not emptiness but authority — like a vast choir waiting for the right moment to sing.

Their eyes fell upon the soul, and it trembled. It was not fear, not exactly. It was the sensation of being utterly seen, pierced through and through, with nothing hidden. Reverence welled up — but alongside it, an unease stirred, subtle but sharp: the memory of pulpits and crowns on Earth, of power cloaked in holiness. The soul’s breath faltered before it caught itself, and its companions pressed close, their warmth steadying it.

From the semicircle, one Elder rose. His form was tall and strong, robed in light that flowed like a river of dawn. His presence carried an archetype the soul knew instinctively — the Father. Yet here he bore no sternness, no shadow of tyranny. His face radiated warmth; his eyes carried infinite kindness. His hands opened not to command, but to welcome.

“I am the one you have remembered in fragments,” he said, voice deep yet tender, resonant as both thunder and whisper. “On Earth, my image was fractured, cast in shadows of power and fear. But here I stand as I truly am — not above the others, but one among them. One face of the Infinite, one note in the chorus of love.”

The soul’s knees weakened, tears spilling as it bowed. To see this figure — familiar yet redeemed, strong yet endlessly gentle — was to feel a wound long carried begin to ease.

The Elder stretched out a hand. “Come, child. You have returned to the table of creation. There is much to see, much to plan. But first — rest in the knowledge that you are home.”

The Council’s light swelled like a tide, enveloping the chamber in radiance. Awe and belonging filled the soul, yet somewhere deep, hidden and quiet, another current stirred — a flicker of resistance, a shadowed memory of power misused. It passed as quickly as it came, leaving the soul uncertain whether it had imagined it.

The Planning Center had opened its arms. And within its embrace, a storm waited, still distant, but drawing near.
