# Twilight in the Park

The journey from the Planning Center felt lighter, as though the weight of the chamber’s gravity had been replaced by a softness that invited rest. The soul walked alongside its guide and group, laughter beginning to rise among them, low and easy. Ahead stretched a park, wide and welcoming, its meadows bathed in a twilight glow.

Here, twilight was not darkness. There was no night as the soul had known it on Earth. Instead, the light dimmed gently, tenderly, as though the heavens themselves whispered: *now, rest awhile.* Stars did not pierce the sky, for the sky itself shimmered like a living canvas, deep hues of rose and indigo flowing together. Across it streaked lines of silver light, like comets painting arcs of beauty across the firmament.

The soul’s group returned to the table where they had gathered before. Upon it now lay small desserts they had picked up in the city’s marketplace — confections of light that shimmered like jewels, yet melted sweetly upon the tongue. They sat together, nibbling and savoring, laughter and contentment flowing between them.

One soul leaned forward, eyes bright. “I’m going to the countryside,” she said, smiling. “I want to learn more about farming, about coaxing life from the soil. The farmer showed us only the beginning. There’s more joy there to taste.”

Another nodded eagerly. “I’ll join you. I want to see what it feels like to grow food with my own hands, not from hunger but from delight. To watch trees spring into blossom with a sweep of the arm — what a wonder!”

Across the table, another spoke, her aura glowing warmly. “I’m heading to the suburbs. They’re building a new playground for the children, and I want to help. To set the swings, to paint the fence, to laugh with them as they play. The sound of their joy fills me more than anything else.”

Two others, their light strong and steady, exchanged a glance before speaking. “We are going back to Earth,” one said simply. “There is still work to do there. The veil is thinning, and hearts are waking. We will carry light into the shadows, now with greater strength, for we know the Council’s support flows with us.”

They turned toward the soul, their eyes soft. “And you? What will you do?”

The soul shrugged, gazing down at its dessert, then back up at the twilight sky. *“I don’t know. I don’t think I’m ready to go back to Earth. Not yet.”*

“That is okay,” the guide said, his voice gentle, full of reassurance. “Earth will always be there, waiting to receive your light, to be graced by your gifts. There is no rush. There is time here — cycles of learning, cycles of rest. You need only choose what nourishes your soul.”

The group fell into a comfortable silence. They turned their chairs to face the water at the park’s edge. The lake mirrored the twilight sky, rippling softly, streaked with silver and rose. Music floated faintly, quieter now, soothing — less a chorus than a lullaby, flowing from creation itself.

The soul breathed deeply, its chest rising and falling in a rhythm of peace. For the first time, it felt the fullness of breath not as survival, but as abundance, as joy.

“This is home,” the soul whispered to itself. “I have always been here. And I always will be.”

The sky shimmered above them, comets of light arcing gracefully through the twilight, as the soul sat in the warmth of its group — whole, embraced, at rest.
