## The Banquet

The tapestry of memories shimmered once more, then slowly faded into radiance. The soul stood quietly, trembling from the depth of what had just been lived — shadows faced, lessons embodied, love received. It was overwhelming in its fullness.

And then — a touch.

A soft hand rested on its shoulder. The soul turned to see its guide.

Their form was familiar yet fluid, shifting like water in sunlight. At moments robed, at moments a figure of pure radiance, their face seemed both youthful and ancient. Laughter lingered in their eyes, wisdom traced faint lines across their brow. Care radiated from them — not the polite kindness of a stranger, but the fierce tenderness of one who had walked beside the soul for lifetimes.

The soul’s heart swelled. “You.”

The guide smiled, eyes glowing like embers. “Yes. I’ve been here all along.”

They leaned close, their voice like music spoken gently. “The hardest part is behind you. You faced the shadow and came through whole.” Their hand squeezed with reassurance. “Now — would you like to see everyone? They can’t wait. They’ve missed you so much.”

The soul felt a rush it had not known in ages: anticipation. After so much heaviness, the thought of reunion flowed like spring water.

Ahead, a doorway of light widened. Within it, shadows moved — not ominous, but alive, figures gathering with eagerness. Their presence pulsed like heartbeats waiting to be shared.

The guide extended a hand. “Come. It’s time.”

The soul hesitated only a breath, then reached out. Warmth surged through, strength returning like a gift.

Together they walked toward the light. The closer they came, the stronger the music swelled — not solemn now, but celebratory, woven with laughter and joy. The voices grew familiar. Beloved. Anticipation swelled until it felt too large to contain.

As the threshold loomed, the guide whispered: “Welcome home.”

The soul stepped into a hall vast and radiant, yet warm as a hearth. It shimmered like a great dining chamber, carved not of stone but of living light. Pillars rose like luminous trees, walls glowed like woven gold, and long tables stretched outward, set not with food but with brightness and song.

At first the brilliance blurred the faces. Then shapes clarified, and recognition struck.

There — a grandmother, her face young again, though every smile of her earthly years seemed still etched in her aura. She lifted her hands in joy, eyes brimming with light.

Nearby stood a childhood friend gone too soon, his laugh bursting across the room before his face even came into focus. His grin was the same, mischievous and kind, his aura sparkling like quicksilver.

More faces came: a mentor, steady as always, now glowing in indigo wisdom; a cousin lost in middle age, their light golden-green with generosity.

And then — others the soul could not place, yet felt as familiar as breath. Each bore a unique aura. One shimmered in radiant gold, steady as sunlight on stone. Another pulsed violet, mysterious yet kind, carrying the air of a poet. A third gleamed emerald and silver, laughter ringing like bells.

The soul realized with awe: these were not just companions from the most recent life, but from many lifetimes — threads woven through centuries, perhaps millennia. Friends, kin, even passing strangers once met on Earth now revealed as eternal family.

Everywhere, colors mingled — blue streaming into red, gold swirling with green — each aura distinct yet part of a single harmony, like stained glass lit by one sun.

The room vibrated with joy. Hands clasped, arms embraced, laughter and tears mingled. Love filled the hall like music too vast to be contained.

The soul, overwhelmed, laughed and wept at once. Homecoming. Recognition. Not one had forgotten. Not one had turned away. They had been waiting, holding love across the veil — and now, at last, they were together.

The guide whispered: “This is your family. Your circle. You belong.”

And in that dining hall of light, the soul knew it was true.

The hall shimmered as all the gathered souls took their places at the long tables of light. No wood scraped, no chairs creaked, yet the warmth was unmistakable — like a supper after a long journey. Before each soul appeared a cup of radiant drink, glowing as though drawn from the heart of a star.

The soul sat among them, still trembling with awe. Anticipation buzzed in the air like the hush before a chorus begins.

Then the jovial soul — the one whose aura sparkled silver and whose laughter rang loudest — lifted his cup high.

“Well!” he boomed, grin wide. “Let’s get this party started!”

Laughter rippled through the hall. Above them, sparks of light burst like confetti.

The jovial soul leaned forward. “Do you remember the time—” and launched into a story from the life just lived.

As he spoke, the very air responded. Light coalesced into images. The memory bloomed in full dimension — not only seen, but tasted, felt, heard. Grass bent under phantom wind, familiar scents filled the air, laughter echoed as though the moment itself had returned.

The hall erupted in delight. Souls clapped, cheered, raised their cups as the story unfolded, reliving it together.

When the tale ended, another voice chimed in — a gentle soul whose aura glowed emerald and silver. She leaned forward, smiling knowingly. “Oh, that reminds me of the time—” and immediately launched into another story. Again the light shimmered, and another scene blossomed in vivid detail.

This one was quieter: a moment of kindness, small at the time, now radiant in memory. The hall hushed, every soul leaning in, hearts swelling with appreciation. Then laughter bubbled again when someone added a playful detail the soul had nearly forgotten.

On and on it went. Story after story, memory after memory, spilled into the hall. Each one was caught, savored, woven into the collective joy. The life just lived — with all its humor, pain, love, and folly — was remembered not as solitary, but as shared.

The soul sat in wonder. It realized the truth: the life it thought had been lived alone had never been solitary at all. Every laugh, every tear, every kindness or cruelty had rippled through this circle, binding them together.

Now, in this banquet of joy, the life was not reviewed but celebrated. Not shamed for flaws, not idolized for triumphs — simply cherished in its wholeness. Each detail added richness to the tapestry of all their lives.

The hall glowed brighter. Laughter and song swelled higher, until it felt as though heaven itself joined the feast.

And the soul knew: it was home.
