### The Journey to the Heavenly City

The path wound gently through golden fields, where the air smelled faintly of earth and blossoms. Ahead, the soul noticed a figure bent low over the soil. A farmer stood there, sleeves rolled back, hands moving in slow, steady arcs as though conducting a quiet symphony with the ground.

Curious, the soul stepped closer. “What are you doing?” it asked.

The farmer straightened, brushing a glowing hand across his brow. His face was warm, sunlit, his aura tinged with amber and green. He smiled as though he’d been waiting for the question. “I’m planting crops.”

The soul tilted its head. “But… we don’t eat food here. Why plant crops at all?”

The farmer’s eyes twinkled, laughter playing at their edges. “Ah, you’re right. We don’t plant from necessity. We plant from joy. To see life spring from the soil by the movement of my hands — that is my feast. Would you like to see?”

The soul nodded eagerly.

The farmer knelt, pressing his palm to the earth. Slowly, he lifted his arm in a gentle arc, as though beckoning something unseen. At once, the soil stirred. A green shoot broke through, fragile yet determined, reaching toward the sky.

The farmer swept his hand once more, and the shoot stretched upward, unfurling leaves, thickening into a slender stalk. Another motion, and the stalk swelled, branches spreading wide. Within what seemed only a minute, a full tree stood before them, its leaves glistening with dew though no rain had fallen.

Then, like stars appearing at dusk, small orbs swelled upon the branches — fruit, round and glowing faintly with inner light. Their fragrance filled the air, sweet and rich, a scent that seemed to hum with promise.

The farmer plucked one gently and offered it to the soul. “Here. Taste.”

The soul hesitated, then bit into the fruit. Juice burst across its tongue — sweet beyond any peach or apple known on Earth, yet also fresh like spring water. With each swallow, warmth pulsed outward, filling the body with light. Energy cascaded through its being, bright and effervescent, as though every cell had been kissed by the sun.

The soul gasped, clutching the fruit. “It’s… alive!”

The farmer laughed, delighted. “Of course. Here, work is not for survival. It is for joy. The joy of creation, and the joy of sharing what is created. What you tasted was not only fruit — it was the essence of delight, woven into the flesh of the tree.”

The soul closed its eyes, feeling the afterglow ripple through. This was no nourishment for hunger, but for spirit itself. Every drop was gift, every sweetness a reminder that love can take form in infinite ways.

The farmer placed a hand upon the tree’s bark, stroking it fondly. “Each seed I plant is a song. Each harvest, a hymn. There is no toil here, only the dance of creation. I give not because I must, but because it makes me whole to give. And when others taste, their joy returns to me, completing the circle.”

The soul stood in silence, holding the half-eaten fruit, watching light pulse faintly from its core. Something in it shifted — the memory of Earth’s endless labor, of sweat and hunger and striving, softened into a vision of what work could be: not burden, but blessing.

The guide stepped forward then, laying a gentle hand on the soul’s shoulder. “This is how creation is meant to be. Not toil that drains, but joy that renews.”

The farmer bowed slightly, his aura glowing like a late summer sun. “Go on now. There is more for you to see.”

The soul nodded, handing the fruit’s remains back to the soil, where it dissolved into sparks of light. Ahead, beyond the fields and cottages, the Heavenly City shimmered more clearly — towers of luminous stone rising like dawn, their glow spreading across the horizon.

The guide’s voice was steady and kind. “Are you ready to see the City?”

The soul, still warm with the fruit’s radiance, breathed deeply. “Yes. I’m ready.”

And so they walked on, the countryside gently fading behind them, while the brilliance of the City grew larger with every step.
