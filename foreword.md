# Foreword

Ever since our family lost our daughter to illness, I have carried a deep fascination with what awaits us after death. Grief opened in me a yearning to understand, to listen, and to imagine. I found myself watching near-death experiences and reading accounts of hypnotic regressions into that liminal space beyond time. These stories have been a comfort to me. They are like trying to recall the most beautiful dream you’ve ever had—vague impressions, brief flickers of recognition, yet undeniably familiar.

One day, while scrolling through social media, I came across a post from an acquaintance. His words were raw, heavy with pain and anger. I wondered: what happens to a soul when it is released from the signals of the body, no longer bound by a limbic system that magnifies suffering? How does a soul recover, heal, and remember its true nature after such weight?

This story grew from that wondering. I leaned on the imagery of light and sound, for I have long hoped my own life review might one day unfold as a symphony—full of drama and tenderness, discord and harmony, yet ultimately resolved into beauty. *The Journey Home* is my attempt to paint that picture: a meditation on what it might mean to pass through suffering, memory, and love, until at last we are welcomed back into the embrace of the Eternal.

May these words kindle a flicker of recognition within you. May they lift your heart toward the hope that death is not the end, but a homecoming.

In His Light,

—Michael
